# Join A Board
A reminder app prototype for CMSC 173 - Human-Computer Interaction. <br/><br/>
This app is specifically designed for the Experimental Design the researcher made. Currently, there is only one board, and one announcement. <br/>

## Current Features
- board code: BOARD1234
- deadline: within the day
- can work without internet connection, just don't reload or go back when you've opened the app
- a download, containing the name you've entered and time you've responded to the announcement, will start once you've responded to the announcement (designed for the researcher's experiment)
